# Fruit-Ninja-Clone-Prototype

This is the prototype of the fruit ninja clone that I am creating for WOC 7.0 and submitting for mid evaluations.

The “background.png” is the photo that I have used as the background, which I just picked up from google.

The “index.html” is the html file, it just contains a canvas and is linked to the CSS and JavaScript files.

The “style.css” file only makes sure that everything has a margin of 0 pixels and also gives the canvas it’s border and background image.

The “script.js” file contains mainly all of the content in this stage. So I will try my best to briefly explain it.

1 to 4 circles are generated randomly anywhere below the screen every 5 seconds, these circles have 4 random colors and fixed size.  All of these circles have upward velocities and horizontal velocities towards the center of the screen with randomized magnitudes. These circles perform projectile motion under gravity. If the cursor is moved onto the circles their radius is changed to 0, hence making them vanish.
